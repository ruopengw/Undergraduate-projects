Here are my course projects of Artificial Intelligence.

1. Mini-AlphaGo Reversi
- Programmed in python with Anaconda via the algorithm of Monte Carlo Tree Search.
- Realized a man-AI reversi game. AI is able to make judgment in 60 seconds.

2. Garbage Classification
- Used thousands of labelled pictures of garbages as a dataset to train a deep neural network aimed at classification. I preprocessed pictures via OpenCV and built the model via Keras framework. Finally the model realized high accuracy (90%) to classify these 6 kinds of garbage.

3. Image Restoration
- Used linear regression model and several filtering methods to predict every damaged pixel.
- Evaluated the restoration result by calculating 2-norm, SSIM similarity, cosine similarity between the restored picture and the original picture.
- Able to restore 95% of the high-spoiled picture.


4. Conditional GAN
- Established a conditional generative adversarial network, adjust the parameters as god as possible. 
- During the training process, the cGAN can generate pictures based on MNIST dataset.
- Calculated the similarity between the generated pictures and the original pictures to test the network's performance.
